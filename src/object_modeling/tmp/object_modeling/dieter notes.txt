notes for talking to dieter:

- patch orientation
- analyze plane slipping
- color masking:
	- boosting?
	- color averaging?
	- color space?
- associating model points with frame points (negative information)

- objects in patches

Things I said I'd do but didn't:
- avoid masking out fully contained skin pixels
- record a new sequence with a modified object eliminating the tricky side, though I can see that other sides may be tricky as well, and more generally, a lot of objects have tricky views.
- run the old truck sequence through the patch volumes just to see if I can get any semblance of loop closure working on that.  I'm not optimistic.

Something else:
- linear interpolate color (eh...not important when voxels > pixels)


from talk:
- neighborhood search (frame to model as opposed to model to frame)
- collect in-hand sequences with kinect 2
- do the patch volume reorientation
- jump back to old volumes for alignment
- DEMONSTRATE complete map
- RSS RGB-D workshop (may 30) ("infinite mapping")
